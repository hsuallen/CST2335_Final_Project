## Where's the Microwave?

### Purpose

*Where's the Microwave?* is an app created by students for the purpose of
CST2335 final project. This project is a collaboration project between four
students, and the students have approximately a month or more to complete the
app. The students that worked on the app are as follows:

+ Allen Hsu
+ Scott McClare
+ Wei Cui
+ Jacob Heaton

### Background

The idea of *Where's the Microwave?* came one day when Scott was trying to heat
up his lunch, but he spended over 20 minutes trying to find a microwave. The
basic idea for the app is so that the user can find the nearest amenity in need.
An example of an amenity could be microwaves, water fountains, printers, etc.
The ones that we have decided to implement in our app are as follows:

+ Microwaves
+ Vending machines
+ Printers
+ Washrooms

Each of the group members are responsible for implementing an amenity listed
above, and since each amenity are handled by different people, each activity
will have different style and looks to it.
